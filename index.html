          <h3>We know what you're thinking...</h3>
          <p>"Salmon cookies?? Is this a joke?" </br>Well, yes... and no. Technically, our cookies <em>started</em> as a
            joke between Patrick "Pat" Eli Krahenbuhl and a few Seattle friends. But Pat was inspired by the wild
            success
            of the savory-to-sweet crossover that bacon had achieved atop maple donuts and decided that salmon deserved
            a
            fair shot at confectionery glory, too!</p>

      <div class="flex full">
        <img src="img/frosted-cookie.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="blurb">Pat got to work and quickly discovered that just a small piece of smoked salmon could infuse an entire double
          batch of maple cookie with a sublime flavor that surpassed all his expectations. It took some convincing to
          get
          his friends and family to try his unconventional creation, but invariably they were all converted to diehard
          salmon cookie fanatics, and began begging Pat to make them for parties, weddings, and funerals. As the word
          spread, demand for these intriguing delights became so strong that Pat had no choice but to set up shop and
          make
          them available to the world!</p>
